# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

## 📌 Overview

The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is an interactive web-based tool that demonstrates how operating systems manage virtual memory using different page replacement strategies. The simulator visualizes memory frame allocation, page hits, and page faults, helping users understand memory management concepts through real-time simulation.

## 🚀 Features

* Implements FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms
* Step-by-step visualization of memory frame allocation
* Page hit and page fault detection
* Performance comparison across algorithms
* Bar chart representation of page fault counts
* User input for reference string and frame size

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

* First In First Out (FIFO)
* Least Recently Used (LRU)
* Optimal Page Replacement

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Chart.js (for data visualization)

## ▶ How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. Enter number of frames and reference string
4. Click **Run Simulation**

## 📊 Output

The simulator displays:

* Frame updates at each step
* Page hit / fault status
* Total page faults
* Algorithm comparison chart

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to provide a visual and interactive understanding of page replacement algorithms used in virtual memory management in operating systems.
